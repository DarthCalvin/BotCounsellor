# BotCounsellor
A bot which exploits AI to counsel people and situations who are at conflict over different ideas of right and wrong.
I have spent a considerable amount of time, sometimes willingly, at resolving disputes between people at conflict. I realized that if a person is attempting this arbitration process, the parties tend to get suspicious or hostile. Hence, I am here attempting to train a bot which can take over this function, which won't be subject to the drawbacks mentioned above,simply because it's a bot and not a human.
